/* The sound: the engine's own state machine over the AIL driver -- the music's choice of track and its loads, the four
 * sound-effect slots and their ageing, and the two settings.
 *
 * None of it makes a sound. The driver (src/uw_ail.c, m->ail) sequences the
 * score and hands channel messages to the host's synthesiser; what lives
 * here is what the engine keeps in its own data segment, which the pairs
 * see: music_track_playing and _wanted, the sequence handle, the combat
 * music's clock, and the effect slots -- active, note, program, channel,
 * countdown -- with the channels they hold in snd_channel_alloc_mask.
 * snd2's footstep is one of these: slot 0, note 0x1d on channel 9 for four
 * sixteenths of a second.
 *
 * Two things run from the driver's timer rather than from a pass, and the
 * host calls them: uw_ail_tick at 120 Hz and uw_motion_sound_age_slots at
 * 16 Hz (sfx_timer_install's ail_register_timer). With no driver (m->ail
 * NULL) the host leaves music_available and sfx_available clear, as
 * sound_init does with none configured, and every function here returns at
 * its first line.
