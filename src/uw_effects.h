/* The level's animated objects: level_effect_list and the
 * routines that keep it, level_effects_tick, level_effect_animate
 * and level_effect_expire.
 *
 * An EFFECT is a record naming an object -- the fountains, fires and
 * shimmering things of item class 7, 0x1c0..0x1cf -- whose frame the game
 * advances: six bytes, the object's index in word 0's top ten bits, a
 * countdown (-1 is permanent) and the tile it stands in. A level's list is
 * LEV.ARK slot 9 + level, 0x180 bytes, a live prefix ended by an index of 0
 * (level_effects_load).
 *
 * THE FRAME IS THE OBJECT'S QUALITY. Byte +6's low six bits, which the draw
 * list's producer adds to 0x1c0 to pick the sprite. What a kind does with it
 * is OBJECTS.DAT's last section, animation_props: sixteen four-byte records
 * of a flag word, a first frame and a frame count. Flag bit 0 steps the
 * frame and wraps to the first; bit 1 picks one at random; bit 2 turns the
 * object and, for a moving door, moves it; bit 7 gives an expiring effect
 * one more animate pass; bit 5 frees the object when its effect expires.
 * Every shipped animation is 0x21, the moving door (0x1cf) 0x84.
 *
 * THE TICK is four a second: dungeon_frame_tick hands
 * level_effects_tick the number of 64-tick boundaries of the 256 Hz clock
 * crossed since the last frame, and a step key hands it one
 * (key_step_or_turn), both only while the effects-on-move flag is set.
 *
 * What this does not carry, counted in `unsupported`: a door swinging
 * shut when no `door_move` is attached (level_effect_move, which asks
 * item_fits_in_tile whether the closed door fits) and the moving door's
 * expiry when no `door_seat` is attached (item_fits_in_tile, the door's own
 * motion and a sound) -- both the game's side's, src/uw_motion_trap.c's
 * level_effect_door_move and _seat -- and freeing an expired effect's
 * object when no pool is attached. */
