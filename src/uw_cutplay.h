/* THE CUTSCENE PLAYER: cutscene_process_data, the 2,969-byte
 * interpreter that is the whole of how a cutscene runs.
 *
 * The pieces it drives are ported separately: the script
 * (uw_cuts.h), the animation files and their RLE (uw_cuts.h again), the
 * palette fades (uw_screen.h) and the strings.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. A cutscene is a numbered SET of files. `.n00` is a script of
 * timed records and `.n01` upwards are animation segments played in turn;
 * nothing about a cutscene is hard-coded except its number. The
 * interpreter runs one frame at a time, and around each frame it runs the
 * script records that are due:
 *
 *     open the script, read 0x800 bytes of it
 *     save the working palette; fade it out, two steps, full screen only
 *     run the records due at frame 0
 *     for each animation file, until op6 ends the cutscene or an open fails:
 *         read the header; palette_to_dac its palette; sort the pages by
 *         their order word; the frame counter starts at 1 AGAIN
 *         for each page in that order, for each frame in the page:
 *             decode the frame into the screen page and present it
 *             run every record whose frame word is this frame counter,
 *             and the chain of records due immediately after it
 *             wait out the frame period, 0x100 / header[0x44] ticks
 *             frame counter += 1
 *
 * THE FRAME WORD IS A TIMELINE TICK, NOT AN INDEX. 96 of the 634 records
 * in UW1's scripts name a frame past the frame count of the file playing
 * at that point, because a hold (op11) or a play-to (op4) keeps the
 * counter running while the last picture stays up. A player that treats
 * the word as an index into the file desynchronises on the first hold.
 *
 * WHAT A PORT MUST DO DIFFERENTLY. The original blocks: its frame loop
 * spins on the clock, polls input, runs its palette fades and services the
 * voice inside itself. Here the host owns the loop, and calls in as often
 * as it likes -- every pass, or once with a clock far ahead -- and this
 * works through what the interpreter would have done by then IN ORDER AND
 * AT THE TICK IT WOULD HAVE DONE IT: a frame goes up when its time comes
 * and the next is timed from that, not from whenever the host happened to
 * call, or a host that looks every four ticks falls a frame behind in a
 * hundred. The fades are the interpreter's too, on the same clock (a frame
 * every UW_FADE_FRAME_TICKS), and so is the DAC they ramp (`dac`); the
 * host presents `screen` through `dac` and sounds what it is asked to.
 *
 * THE VOICE AND THE KLANG are the host's to sound; what the interpreter
 * decides about them is here. With a digital driver (begin's `digital`,
 * state+0x49 bit 5 as digital_is_available leaves it) op13 records its
 * voice at +0x43 INSTEAD of putting up its text -- a voiced cutscene has
 * no subtitles -- and after the frame the records ran on is presented, a
 * voice recorded while none is sounding starts (`voice_start`, for the
 * host to open SOUND\NN.VOC; bit 6 set). cutscene_service_audio, which the
 * original polls through every wait, clears bit 6 and the voice together
 * once playback has finished -- so a voice op13 recorded while another was
 * still sounding is dropped with it, as the introduction's 29.VOC is. An
 * op14 pause with the voice sounding (bit 7) waits for it to end and then
 * its limit in seconds more, counted from the whole seconds already
 * waited; and while a voice is recorded no key or click advances. op15 is
 * sound effect 0x11 at the centre, owed to the host in `effects`.
 *
 * NOT CARRIED, and not counted: the EMS paging, which is a DOS memory
 * strategy rather than behaviour -- this holds the whole file -- and the
 * texture cache the voice's staging pages come from.
