/* A CONVERSATION as the program runs one: conv_begin_with_object
 * through conv_start and converse_refresh, over the ported VM (src/uw_convvm.c), builtins
 * (src/uw_convbi.c), string cache and BGLOBALS -- from CNV.ARK, STRINGS.PAK,
 * BABGLOBS.DAT and the game's memory, for the shell (src/tools/uwshell.c).
 *
 * The original runs a conversation MODALLY: conv_begin_with_object switches
 * to game mode 4, whose enter handler converse_draw_screen draws the screen
 * and calls conv_start, which runs the VM until it ends; a builtin that
 * waits for the player -- babl_menu, babl_fmenu, babl_ask -- loops inside
 * its CALLI, pumping event_dispatch (nothing stands in mode 4) and polling
 * the input, and the digit keys 1..4 and a click on the menu window's rows
 * choose an option (conv_menu_choose). The port's VM pauses at
 * such a CALLI instead, and this session keeps the state between the
 * shell's passes: `wait` says what it waits for, and uw_talk_choose or
 * uw_talk_answer resumes it. The run's end exports the variables, saves
 * the globals, and holds the screen for a click or 500 ticks when the NPC
 * spoke last; uw_talk_finish is converse_refresh and the mode's return. */
