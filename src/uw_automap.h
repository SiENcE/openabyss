/* THE AUTOMAP SCREEN: game mode 2 -- automap_draw, which the
 * map (item 0x13b) opens when it is used from the inventory, and the
 * drawing under it: automap_render, automap_draw_tiles,
 * automap_draw_tile, automap_draw_tile_wall,
 * automap_draw_door, automap_tint_pixel, the notes
 * (automap_notes_load, automap_draw_notes) and
 * automap_show_level behind the paging buttons; for the shell
 * (src/tools/uwshell.c).
 *
 * WHAT THE MAP IS DRAWN FROM. automap_tiles, a byte a tile,
 * which the view's own sweep writes as the player walks: the raw tile type
 * 1..9 for a tile stood in and automap_tile_codes' 0x0a..0x0f for one the
 * sweep merely revealed. Only the first kind is drawn -- three pixels a
 * tile from automap_tile_patterns, with walls laid along any edge whose
 * neighbour is not mapped floor, lighter where that neighbour is 0x0b (an
 * open tile seen but not walked). The map's one primitive is
 * automap_tint_pixel, which READS the parchment pixel under it and darkens
 * it by a constant plus a random spread, which is where the hand-drawn
 * stipple comes from; a port that fills flat colour looks wrong for a
 * reason nothing else in the code explains.
 *
 * The high nibble's two fields -- the floor's fill and an overlay -- are
 * carried (the door mark, the two palette fills and the dark wash), though
 * a UW1 block never sets them: they are the terrain automap_mark_tile ORs
 * in for UW2's sake. */
