/* THE TEXT WINDOWS: scroll_print and the chain under it --
 * scroll_print_segments, text_window_emit_lines, text_window_emit
 * with its escape language and [MORE], text_window_emit_wrapped -- and the
 * window selectors and text_window_clear, ported from the instructions for
 * what they keep in the data segment: the two 21-byte window records
 * (the message scroll and the conversation panel), the
 * current window's pointer, the lines left before [MORE], the
 * mode and pending-clear flags, the scroll's end caps and the panel's edge
 * frames. The drawing is the graphics module's and is not modelled; the
 * text's widths come from the font font_open loaded, which the caller gives.
 *
 * A print that reaches a wait -- an escape's pause (\P, \p) or [MORE] --
 * stops there when `stop_at_wait` is set: a later state stands inside that
 * wait. `resumed` runs a print from inside its opening pause instead, as a
 * state that stood there goes on. */
